{"name":"jMEF","tagline":"","body":"### What are exponential families?\r\n\r\nAn [exponential family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family) exponential family is a generic set of probability distributions that admit the following canonical distribution:\r\n\r\nFormula\r\n\r\nExponential families are characterized by the log normalizer function F, and include the following well-known distributions: Gaussian (generic, isotropic Gaussian, diagonal Gaussian, rectified Gaussian or Wald distributions, lognormal), Poisson, Bernoulli, binomial, multinomial, Laplacian, Gamma (incl. chi-squared), Beta, exponential, Wishart, Dirichlet, Rayleigh, probability simplex, negative binomial distribution, Weibull, von Mises, Pareto distributions, skew logistic, etc. All corresponding formula of the canonical decomposition are given in the documentation.\r\n\r\nMixtures of exponential families provide a generic framework for handling Gaussian mixture models (GMMs also called MoGs for mixture of Gaussians), mixture of Poisson distributions, and Laplacian mixture models as well. \r\n\r\n### What is jMEF?\r\n\r\njMEF is a Java cross-platform library developped by Vincent Garcia and Frank Nielsen. jMEF allows one to:\r\n\r\n* create and manage mixture of exponential families (MEF for short),\r\n* estimate the parameters of a MEF using Bregman soft clustering (equivalent by duality to the Expectation-Maximization algorithm),\r\n* simplify MEFs using Bregman hard clustering (k-means algorithm in natural parameter space),\r\n* define a hierachical MEF using Bregman hierarchical clustering,\r\n* automatically retrieve the optimal number of components in the mixture using the hierarchical MEF structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
